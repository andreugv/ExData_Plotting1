## Instructions

Source .R files into R with <source("filename.R")>.

Call functions with <plotN(filepath)> where N is number of plot desired (make sure all files are sourced first).

All functions (plot1, plot2...) will take as argument filepath (which is the path to the directory containing the unzipped file: household_power_consumption.txt).

The functions will place the resulting plots in the same directory as the unzipped file.
